# MID2OPL2
Midi to OPL2 VGM Converter (Fortran)

<p align = "justify">The project is in a really early state, the goal is to create a standard midi >> OPL2 VGM converter that has as much Fortran code as possible. Unfortunately, the official Intel interface for accessing Windows API did not work, so those are reached by a little Python executable also made by me.</p>
